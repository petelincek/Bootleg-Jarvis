# Bootleg-Jarvis
Tried making Jarvis for PC, but didn't finish (definetly not because I almost made Ultron).

Free voice recognition software/libraries are not the best but they do their job well. I treid using one and was actually suprised, and in a good way. As long as the words are cleanly spoken, the software can register and output the input, which then can be used for varios tasks.
In the future we won't be needing a keyboard or a mouse, but only a microphone (let's hope we don't nuke ourselfs into oblivion first :)
